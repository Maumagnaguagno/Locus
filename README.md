--------------------

[Jason](http://jason.sourceforge.net/) is an AgentSpeak interpreter for multi-agent system development. The agents are describbed in AgentSpeak, but the environment requires a Java description of how the actions and perceptions happen. We aim to close the gap between the descriptions with an AgentSpeak-like description of the environment, targeting new users and simpler examples. Locus generates the Java source required by Jason, giving the user an easier starting point to create complex environments without limiting the user to the tool. The Java output can be further modified if required.
